# authApp
Install react native and it's cli if you done that yet. https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
You'll also need Xcode (for the simulator) or expo https://expo.io/

git pull the repo and run npm install --save 

run react-native run-ios to start the dev server. 

My problem is in the login component. I'm new to es6 destructuring syntax.  I'm trying to pass a function as a prop to a button, but i'm doing something wrong, because console.log(email.value) crashes the app.
